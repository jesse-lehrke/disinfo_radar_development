To give inputs to game you can check out my [play.py](https://play.py) and play\\_util.py functions but basically they just simulate key presses.

No, speed is not constant it can go as fast or slow as it wants but generally it sticks to a range between 70-120 thats probably because those are the speeds that i drove around with the most.
