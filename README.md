# Disinfo_radar_development

Private (in principle, not practice) repository for DRI employees and sub-contractors to develop and test initial functional ideas for Disinformation Radar project. An overview of this project can be found in the documentation folder.

## File structure

As of 11.05.2022 (excluding VENV, including gitgnore directories) can be viewed here ![file structure](/file_structure.txt)
(to-do: automate updating)

The "pipe" folder should be kept clean and is for final MVP code (i.e. deployment ready with only debugging remaining)

## Data

Data folders are set to gitignore except in "pipe". Sharing and syncing of data must be coordinated. 
In the past Syncthing folders embedded in a GitHub directory work well.

## Dependencies

In addition to the requirments.txt the following commands can install other anticipated dependencies:
- nltk.download('stopwords'): run in notebook
- python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm: run in terminal

It is often wise to track major requirements recently removed, or include but not used (for debugging, etc).

The following requirements were recently removed:
- pydude
- playwright

The following are including in the requirements but not used (iirc):
- pyppeteer
- selenium
- selenium-wire

## Conceptual flow
